The increasing demand for electricity is an ever-growing problem that needs to be addressed. The demand for electricity has not kept up with the rate of production over the last century. To better understand the current and future needs for electricity, it is important to look at the data and patterns from past energy production and usage.
Using the available datasets, it is possible to gain insights into the future needs for electricity and create forecasts for the increase in electricity demand and production. These forecasts can be used to better manage electricity production and ensure it is sustainable for the future. It is also important to look at the impact of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources on electricity production and how these sources can be managed to create a sustainable energy future. With the right data and analysis, understanding the increase in electricity demand and production can be made easier, and the industry can be better managed for the future.
